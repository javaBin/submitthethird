        <h3>April 22nd - Submission deadline</h3>

        <p>By this day, at the latest, all speakers are informed about whether their talk was selected or not. Fingers crossed!</p>

        <h3>August 1st - Deadline for refund application</h3>
        <p>If you are traveling to Oslo without receiving coverage by your employer, you can have your expenses covered by us. In order to plan our budget, we need you to apply for coverage. You will receive information on the process in the email that confirms that your submission was accepted. Please note that only presentation speakers and workshop facilitators are eligible for such coverage.</p>


        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>Name your lightning talk, presentation or workshop in a way that draws attention to your submission while also capturing its content. Many participants will use this title to decide if they even read your abstract, so we recommend you to think a few minutes about this name.</p>
        <input class="input" type="text" size="80" placeholder="A short and snappy title" id="title">
        <h2>Language</h2>
        <p>In which language will you be holding the talk? It is permitted to use English in your slides, even though you may be speaking in Norwegian, but you should fill out this form in the language you will speak in. We generally recommend that you hold the talk in the language you are most comfortable with, as we do not favor one language over the other.</p>
        <div>
            <input type="radio" name="language" value="NORWEGIAN" id="languageno">

        </div>
        <!-- $("input[name='language']:checked").val();-->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Give a concise description of the content and goals of your talk and what audience this presentation or workshop is for. Try not to exceed 300 words, as shorter and more to-the-point descriptions are more likely to be read by participants.</p>

        <h2>Your participation (not public)</h2>
        <p>We consider any speaker as a participant of our conference, and we hope that you can stay for both conference days. There is much to see and do during JavaZone, we promise that it will be a good investment of your time! If you cannot participate on both days, please let us know, such that we can consider this when creating the program. To simplify our planning, we can unfortunately not consider time preferences on a given day.</p>
